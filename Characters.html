            <h1>Jinx</h1>
            <p>A manic and impulsive character who lives to wreak havoc without care of the consequences. 
                The arsenal of deadly weapons, she unleashes the loudest blasts and brightest explosions that 
                leave a trail of mayhem and panic. Jinx despises boredom and gleefully brings her chaotic brand and 
                pandemonium wherever she goes.</p>
            <br>
            
            <p>Jinx was an innocent girl from Zaun. No one knows for certain what happened to turn that sweet young child into a wildcard. 
                She first gained notoriety through her anonyumous pranks that ranged from the moderately annoying to the criminally 
                dangerous. </p>
            <br>
            <p>The wardens attributed some of her crimes to gangs from the undercity. Having others get credit for her manic schemes, 
                Jinx made sure that her presence was made in every future crime scene. Soon, rumors started circulating of the blue 
                haired Zaunite girl carring chemtech explosives, a shark mounted rocket launcher and a reaper gun. </p>

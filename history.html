        <h1 class="pealkiri">How Zaun came to be?</h1>
        <p>Zaun is located between two continents: Valoran and Shurima. All trade between the continents has to go through the city. This means that many scholars, travelers, scientists and merchants regularly travel through it, many of whom decide to stay permanently. As a result of all the wealth pouring through Zaun, the wealthier part of the city started to literally pull away and eventually broke off to form Piltover, while the the rest of Zaun sank deeper into the earth.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Now the two city-states exist side by side like night and day. The soaring state of Piltover, known as the city of progress, art, craftsmanship, trade and innovative technologies is inceadebly wealty where as Zaun is known for unstable and illegal research, a massive and reckless industry as well as rapid unchecked development.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The streets of Zaun are filled with dangerous gasses in the air and toxic liquid beneath the citizens feet, but even here people find a way to exist and prosper. Many of the goods coming to Piltover find their way into Zaunâ€™s black markets, and hextech inventors who find the restrictions placed upon them in the city above too restrictive often find their dangerous researches welcomed in Zaun.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h1 class="pealkiri">The pride of Zaun</h1>
        <p>While known to be a notoriously self-centered people by other nations, the denizens of Zaun collectively take great pride in themselves and their city. To them, their right to do as they please is what makes Zaun the freest city in Runeterra. As a result, the streets of Zaun are a constant hive of activity.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Shopkeepers with a variety of eccentric items can be found at every corner of the city, with the dark and seedy alleys overflowing with ambitious individuals willing to give their all for a profit. It's also said that corporate rivalry is the very spirit of competition that defines Zaun as a city-state. Nevertheless, both espionage and sabotage are considered common practices when doing business with Zaunites.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h1 class="pealkiri">Research and technology</h1>
        <p>While Zaun's ambitious patrons do much to advance the field of science on Runeterra, their research and inventions often push the boundaries of morality on a daily basis.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The nation of Zaun is particularly famous for its alchemists, who sometimes light up the city with their magical concoctions. Perhaps the most infamous alchemist is Singed, who is best known for creating genocidal toxins which are potent enough to wipe out entire villages.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Denied the funds and means to craft hextech, Zaun's researchers instead use potent chemicals to power their creations called chemtech. Used to create utilitarian/practical artifacts that can be used by anyone. It harnesses chemical energy to power machinery, and produce light and heat. Chemtech performs like hextech, but is far more dangerous, toxic and explosive. </p>
        <br>
        <p>One example of Zaunites' love for freedom of expression is the unlawful synthesis of "shimmer", a corrosive waste substance that is popular among Zaun's rebellious youth. When slathered onto the skin the Shimmer stimulates intense emotions in its subject. The Shimmer then creates an assortment of shining colors that corresponds to the emotion the subject is feeling. Though frequent application of the caustic glop can result in progressive degeneration of the skin and muscle tissue, a rumor that Shimmer can grant its wearer unnatural abilities has simply increased its demand.</p>
